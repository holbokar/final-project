            <img id="talula-photo" src="images/talula.jpg">
            <p>The perfect Friday night date consists of sitting in the courtyard of Talula's, enjoying drinks, dinner and dessert. Amazing weather doesn't hurt either.</p>

            <p>We started with cocktails: the country singer and the weekend gardener. My fiance liked the country singer so much, he had 2. The weekend gardener was a gin drink, a bit on the sour side. I loved it...</p>

            <p>Audrey Claire is an absolute gem. Each dish was incredible and the prices can't be beat.</p>

            <p>My fiance and I had the grilled artichokes, the seared haloumi, the pear and gorgonzola flatbread and the grilled whole branzino. I don't have one complaint...</p>

        <img id="in-riva-photo" src="images/in-riva.jpg">
            <p>In Riva has stolen my heart. Great service, an outdoor patio and fantastic pizza make it the perfect spot for any occasion but particularly for the great springtime weather that's finally here to stay in Philadelphia.</p>

            <p>For food, we did the broccolini ceasar, the margherita pizza and the burrata pizza. I'm obsessed with In Riva's take on the ceasar salad; the broccolini was fresh and cooked to perfection and the dressing was light but super flavorful...</p>

            <p>My fiance and I stopped by Alma de Cuba on a Thursday night around 7:30pm. We were seated immediately and our server promptly took our drinks orders, which is where the good review for Alma de Cuba ends.</p>

            <p>First the drinks: we both ordered mojitos, which were fine but nothing to write home about. I had a caiprinha as well; it was basic but better than than the mojito. Both drinks lacked flavor and neither tasted like they had very much alcohol...</p>

        <img id="knead-photo" src="images/knead.jpeg">  
            <p>I moved from NYC 2 months ago and have been searching for a bagel shop to replace my favorite NYC location. Well, I've found it!</p> 
                
            <p>I love Knead Bagels. The service is efficient and friendly, the prices are great (way better than NYC) and the bagels are super flavorful and creative plus the ingredients are SO fresh....</p>

            <p>The vegan scene in Philly is outstanding and I expected no less from favorably reviewed V Street. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. It's a decent choice but nothing to write home about.</p>

            <p>The best: the Bora Bora banter drink was amazing. If I visit V Street again, it will be for their drinks....</p>
