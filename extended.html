        <h3 id="article-1">Talula's Garden</h3>
        <p>The perfect Friday night date consists of sitting in the courtyard of Talula's, enjoying drinks, dinner and dessert. Amazing weather doesn't hurt either.</p>

        <p>We started with cocktails: the country singer and the weekend gardener. My fiance liked the country singer so much, he had 2. The weekend gardener was a gin drink, a bit on the sour side. I loved it.</p>
        
        <p>We had the salmon crudo to start. My fiance loved it; I thought it was okay. The amount of salmon was pretty weak and the flavor wasn't all there for me. Next up was the ricotta ravioli and the steak and egg for him plus crispy potatoes and cucumber and edamame salad. Everything was wonderful. We finished with the stracciatella sundae and a glass of port. I was hoping the stracciatella sundae would mirror the gelato I had in Italy. Not quite there but nothing was left in the bowl! It was our anniversary and they also brought us cake. We definitely did not leave hungry.</p>
            
        <p>Our server was fantastic - super attentive the whole night. The only miss: she forgot to bring the port with dessert but immediately offered to take it off the bill.</p>
        
        <p>Such a great experience at Talula's Garden!</p></div>

    <h3 id="article-2">Audrey Claire</h3> 
        <p>Audrey Claire is an absolute gem. Each dish was incredible and the prices can't be beat.</p>

        <p>My fiance and I had the grilled artichokes, the seared haloumi, the pear and gorgonzola flatbread and the grilled whole branzino. I don't have one complaint. The artichokes were cooked perfectly and came with lemon to add flavor. The seared haloumi was just the right amount of chewy, the gorgonzola and pear flatbread could have been dessert and the branzino was prepared simply but it was so fresh that it did not need additional flavoring.</p>
            
        <p>Make sure to pick up a bottle of wine, stop at the ATM before you go and get prepared for one of the best dinners in Philadelphia.</p>

    <h3 id="article-3">In Riva</h3>    
        <p>In Riva has stolen my heart. Great service, an outdoor patio and fantastic pizza make it the perfect spot for any occasion but particularly for the great springtime weather that's finally here to stay in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>For food, we did the broccolini ceasar, the margherita pizza and the burrata pizza. I'm obsessed with In Riva's take on the ceasar salad; the broccolini was fresh and cooked to perfection and the dressing was light but super flavorful. The margherita pizza was the best I've had in Philly so far; the sauce was amazing, they didn't skimp on the mozzarella and the crust was doughy and delicious. The burrata pizza was also very good but the margherita definitely wins in a competition between the two.</p>
            
        <p>We also ordered two pitches of their rose sangria. It was refreshing and tasty but to be honest, I'm not sure there was much alcohol involved.</p>
            
        <p>I want to go back to In Riva for a broccolini ceasar and margherita pizza right now.</p>

    <h3 id="article-4">Alma de Cuba</h3>  
        <p>My fiance and I stopped by Alma de Cuba on a Thursday night around 7:30pm. We were seated immediately and our server promptly took our drinks orders, which is where the good review for Alma de Cuba ends.</p>

        <p>First the drinks: we both ordered mojitos, which were fine but nothing to write home about. I had a caiprinha as well; it was basic but better than than the mojito. Both drinks lacked flavor and neither tasted like they had very much alcohol.</p>
        
        <p>For the food: we ordered the yellowtail ceviche, the cuban chopped salad, guacamole and the paella da mariscos. As soon as we tasted the yellowtail ceviche, we knew something was not right. The fish tasted old and even the (overly) sweet sauce that it was covered in could not mask how "fishy" it tasted. We rarely send dishes back but this one had to go. We ordered the cuban chopped salad instead, which had potential but was completely overdressed. The paella was basically a plate of rice with a few pieces of seafood laying on top. The guac was the only good thing about the entire meal.</p>
        
        <p>For the service: our server was super friendly and prompt...until she left and never came back. We weren't notified that our server would be leaving or that someone new would be helping us. Instead, the new server came over and told us he had been waiting to put in our order once we finished our apps. Well, we weren't going to finish our apps because they weren't good.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe Alma de Cuba was having an off night but I don't think I'll be back again.</p>

    <h3 id="article-5">Knead Bagels</h3> 
        <p>I moved from NYC 2 months ago and have been searching for a bagel shop to replace my favorite NYC location. Well, I've found it! I love Knead Bagels. The service is efficient and friendly, the prices are great (way better than NYC) and the bagels are super flavorful and creative plus the ingredients are SO fresh.</p>

        <p>I've been to Knead twice - the first time I had the lox and cream cheese bagel sandwich on an everything bagel. If you're a lox fan, I highly recommend. They really layered on the lox and you definitely get your money's worth.</p>
        
        <p>The second time I had their lunch special - dill tuna on a fennel and salt bagel, with a side of carrots (there are typically 3 different side choices) and an iced tea. All for $9.00 and absolutely delicious. I've found my new favorite lunch spot!</p>   
        

    <h3 id="article-6">V-Street</h3> 
        <p>The vegan scene in Philly is outstanding and I expected no less from favorably reviewed V Street. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. It's a decent choice but nothing to write home about.</p>

        <p>The best: the Bora Bora banter drink was amazing. If I visit V Street again, it will be for their drinks.</p>
        
        <p>The good: the Zhoug avocado was easily my favorite thing that we ordered. It was the only dish that had a ton of flavor. The Peruvian fries were okay; a little bland but if you like potatoes and spicy sauce, it's worth it. The cauliflower tacos were good but the portions really threw me off. The 2 tacos were huge, which just doesn't make sense. For a restaurant that specializes in shared dishes, it would make more sense to provide a larger quantity of smaller tacos.</p>
        
        <p>The okay/not great: the seared market greens, the sanchocho and the spicy dan dan noodles.</p>
        
        <p>I'm willing to give this place one more shot, as long as the Bora Bora banter is still on the menu.</p>
